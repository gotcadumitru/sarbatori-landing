## Analysis

### Skills Match Analysis
**Skills Score: 20**
The candidate demonstrates a perfect match in the required skills for the Front End Developer role, including proficiency in React, JavaScript/TypeScript, and experience with modern web development technologies. The resume showcases extensive experience with React.js, Next.js, and React-Native, aligning with the job's core duty of developing user-facing elements. The absence of specific experience with Electron-based applications did not significantly impact the Skills Score, given the candidate's demonstrated adaptability and proficiency in related technologies.

### Domain Knowledge Insight
**Domain Score: 18**
Dumitru Gotca's resume illustrates a strong background in software development, particularly in front-end and mobile development, which aligns well with the functional job area described. While the candidate has proven experience in the software development domain, there is a slight deduction in score due to the lack of explicit mention of prior work in the health tech industry. The diverse project experience, including web and mobile applications, supports a high Domain Score.

**Tenure Score: 15**
The candidate has been employed as a Front-End Developer at ASSIST SOFTWARE since March 2021, showing a tenure of over 2 years at the time of application. This duration meets the criteria for stability in the role. However, the Tenure Score is not maximized due to the resume listing multiple projects and roles without indicating long-term commitment beyond the current position.

**Network Score: 15**
Based on the candidate's professional experiences and involvement in various projects, it's inferred that they have built a relevant professional network. The work with diverse clients and participation in contests suggests exposure to a broad network.
